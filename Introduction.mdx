# Masjid Management System - Project Overview

## üïå Project Purpose

The **Masjid Management System** is a full-stack web application designed to digitize and streamline the administrative operations of a mosque community. This system serves as a comprehensive management tool for tracking members, managing financial contributions, and organizing community activities across different geographical locations and organizational zones.

## üéØ Core Functionality

### 1. Janaza Fund Management

The primary feature of the system is managing the Janaza fund - a community fund used for funeral expenses and related religious obligations. The system provides:

- **Location-based Member Organization**: Members are organized by geographical locations (25\+ predefined areas including Araliya Uyana, Asiri Uyana, Bandaranayakapura, etc.)
- **Monthly Payment Tracking**: Tracks monthly contributions with statuses: `Paid`, `Not_Paid`, `Pending`, `Waived`
- **Financial Status Management**: Each member has a JSON-based payment history for 2024 (`janaza2024` field)
- **Member CRUD Operations**: Complete create, read, update, delete functionality for member records

### 2. Mahalla Member Management

Manages community members organized by administrative zones:

- **Zone-based Organization**: Members categorized by zones (2C, 3C, 4B, 5B, 6B, 7B, 8B, 9B, 10B, Others)
- **Contact Information Management**: Stores names, addresses, and telephone numbers
- **Zone Filtering**: Ability to filter and display members by specific zones

### 3. User Authentication & Administration

- **JWT-based Authentication**: Secure login system using JSON Web Tokens
- **Admin User Management**: System for creating and managing administrative users
- **Role-based Access**: Differentiation between regular users and administrators

### 4. Future Extensibility

The system includes placeholder sections for:

- **Hifl Madarsa Details**: Islamic education program management (UI prepared, backend pending)

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Backend (Node.js/Express)

### Database Schema

#### Users Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    address TEXT,
    is_admin BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### Members Table (Janaza Fund)

```sql
CREATE TABLE members (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    telephone VARCHAR(50),
    address TEXT,
    location VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    janaza2024 JSONB, -- Monthly payment status: {"jan": "Paid", "feb": "Not_Paid"}
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### Mahallah Members Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE mahallah_members (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    zone VARCHAR(50), -- e.g., "2C", "3C"
    address TEXT,
    telephone VARCHAR(50),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
